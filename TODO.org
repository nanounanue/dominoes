#+end_src

** DONE Unify Player enum
CLOSED: [2026-02-23]

All references and tests updated across 4 files.

* GitHub [1/1]
** DONE Create GitHub repo and push
CLOSED: [2026-02-23]
Repo: https://github.com/nanounanue/dominoes
Remote =origin= = GitHub. GitHub Actions installed (Claude Code review workflows).

* Phase 1 — Foundation [3/3]
** DONE Core Data Model (Agent A)                                :tiles:game_state:
CLOSED: [2026-02-10]
- =tiles.py=: Tile dataclass, full set, suits, utility methods
- =game_state.py=: Player, Team, Play, Pass, GameState, state transitions
- 119 tests passing, 0 pyright errors

** DONE Inference Engine (Agent B)                    :constraints:inference:
CLOSED: [2026-02-10]
- =constraints.py=: PlayerConstraints, ConstraintSet, propagation, arc consistency
- =inference.py=: ProbabilityTable, MC sampling, exact enumeration, auto dispatch
- 63 tests passing, 0 pyright errors

** DONE Math Documentation (Agent C)                               :docs:
CLOSED: [2026-02-10]
- =docs/math.md=: 992-line formal probability model
- Covers state space, posterior, constraint propagation, sampling, worked examples

* Phase 2 — Integration + Viz [2/4]
** DONE Integration pipeline
CLOSED: [2026-02-23]
=engine.py=: OracleState + replay_game.
Wires GameState -> ConstraintSet -> InferenceEngine.

** DONE Integration tests (test_integration.py)
CLOSED: [2026-02-23]
23 integration tests covering:
- Full game replay with the CLAUDE.md example scenario
- Probability invariants (sums, bounds)
- Edge cases (South pass, multi-round games)
- 205 total tests passing

** TODO Tile probability matrix (7x7 heatmap)           :viz:
=viz/tile_matrix.py=: 7x7 grid showing P(unknown tile exists at location)
Color-coded by probability.

** TODO Per-player probability bars                      :viz:
=viz/player_bars.py=: Bar charts showing each opponent's tile probabilities.

* Phase 3 — App + Polish [0/4]
** TODO Interactive game input TUI
=app/main.py=: Textual TUI for entering plays/passes turn by turn.

** TODO Uncertainty timeline
=viz/timeline.py=: Show how uncertainty evolves over rounds.

** TODO Advisor mode
Suggest best play given current probabilities.

** TODO Game replay/undo
Navigate back through game states.
